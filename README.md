+# Phyxion's PD2-Filter
A simple, clean, community driven loot filter

The goal of this filter was to provide a simple, and lightweight lootfilter to eliminate the clutter on the ground, while highlighting the items that are worth picking up. 

## Currently in development
This filter is being actively worked on, so do forgive any blemishes you happen to notice along the way. 

## Features
* Crafting Recipes
* Socketing/Upgrading recipes
* Map immunities, and highest resiostances

## Item values
The filter is driven primarily based on the value of items that drop, with the goal being to allow you to eliminate items below a certain threshold of value with filter levels as you go. 
* 1: Items worth less than Lem, but still potentially worth picking up/corrupting. 
* 2: Items worth between Lem, and Mal that are always worth picking up, and identifying/corrupting.
* 3: Items worth between Mal and Vex that can be worth multiple HRs with good corruptions
* 4: Items worth between Vex and Ber that have GG potential
* 5: The best of the best. Items worth Ber or more that are worth huge amounts. (Dclone/Rathma drops, to name a few)
